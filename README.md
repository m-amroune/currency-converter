# Project : Currency Converter

## About the Project

**Objective** : Build a currency converter application using React. The app allows users to enter an amount, choose a source currency and a target currency, and display the converted result. The project follows FreeCodeCamp’s front-end certification requirements and includes memoization to avoid unnecessary recalculations.

## User Stories

- User Story #1: Your CurrencyConverter component should render an input element to accept the amount to be converted from.
- User Story #2: Your input element should accept numbers.
- User Story #3: Your CurrencyConverter component should render two select elements to choose the currency to convert from and to.
- User Story #4: Your select element should include options for at least USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY. You may use any exchange rate, provided there is no one-to-one mapping between the currencies.
- User Story #5: Your CurrencyConverter component should memoize the calculation of the converted amounts for the from currency such that a change in the to select option will not recalculate the converted amounts.
- User Story #6: Your CurrencyConverter component should render an element showing the converted amount in the format `XX.XX CCC`, where `XX.XX` is the converted amount and `CCC` is the currency code.
- User Story #7: The converted amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
